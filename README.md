# Herdr Workflow Watch

GitHub workflow failure indicators for Herdr workspaces.

Watches the current branch of every open GitHub-backed workspace. `CI: !2` means
two workflow runs need attention; `CI: ?` means GitHub or repository state could
not be read. `CI: …` means status is loading; `CI: ↻` means workflows are queued
or running. Healthy workspaces have no indicator by default; enable `showSuccess`
to display `CI: ✓` when CI has passed. Ineligible workspaces have no indicator.

The watcher resolves the latest pushed commit from GitHub on each poll, including
all actors and events. Local unpushed commits do not hide its failures. Failed,
timed-out, startup-failed and action-required runs need attention; cancelled,
neutral and skipped runs do not. Reruns replace the previous attempt's result.

## Install

Requires Herdr 0.9.0 with socket protocol 22, Git, authenticated [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
and [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) with the toolchain from `mise.toml` installed.
The plugin uses your existing `gh` authentication.

```sh
herdr plugin install timmo001/herdr-workflow-watch
herdr plugin action invoke timmo.workflow-watch.start
herdr plugin config-dir timmo.workflow-watch
```

For a local checkout, run `mise run install` and `mise run build`, then
`herdr plugin link .` and invoke the start action. Linking and reloading do not
run startup hooks. Rebuild before starting a new watcher after source changes.

Add the token to your existing Space rows and bind the picker in Herdr's config:

```toml
[ui.sidebar.spaces]
rows = [
  ["state_icon", "workspace"],
  ["branch", "git_status", { token = "$timmo_workflow_watch", fg = "#f38ba8", dim = false, rules = [{ equals = "CI: ?", fg = "#f9e2af" }, { equals = "CI: …", fg = "#89b4fa" }, { equals = "CI: ↻", fg = "#f9e2af" }, { equals = "CI: ✓", fg = "#a6e3a1" }] }],
]

[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+f"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "timmo.workflow-watch.open"
description = "open workflow failures"
```

Reload with `herdr server reload-config`.
The indicator uses red for failures, blue for loading, amber for unavailable or
in-progress status and green for success. Herdr's sidebar colours must use hex values.

## Actions

Choose **Open all Actions in browser** in the first menu to open the repository's
`/actions` page, including when there are no failures.

Open `timmo.workflow-watch.open` to pick a failure and then:

- **Open failure in browser:** opens the selected run through `gh`.
- **Paste draft into original agent:** inserts the failure at the cursor without
  clearing existing input or submitting it. Available only while that same agent
  is ready, with no approval or question prompt.
- **New agent in this checkout:** asks which agent to launch, creates a pane in
  the originating workspace and submits an investigation/fix prompt.
- **New agent in a new worktree:** asks which agent to launch, creates a unique
  fix branch from the selected pushed commit, opens its Herdr worktree and
  submits the prompt there.

Prompts include repository, branch, SHA, run and job IDs, attempt, URL and failed
steps. Large logs are saved to a local file referenced by the prompt. Terminal
control sequences are removed. A changed branch, run or agent requires reopening
the picker. New-agent prompts ask for uncommitted, unpushed fixes.

## Configuration and state

Create `config.json` in the directory printed by `herdr plugin config-dir`:

```json
{
  "pollSeconds": 30,
  "retrySeconds": 120,
  "timeoutSeconds": 30,
  "concurrency": 3,
  "showSuccess": true,
  "indicatorTemplates": {
    "failure": "CI: !{count}",
    "unavailable": "CI: ?",
    "loading": "CI: …",
    "inProgress": "CI: ↻",
    "success": "CI: ✓"
  },
  "launchers": [
    {
      "id": "custom-opencode",
      "label": "Custom OpenCode",
      "argv": ["/path/to/agent-launcher"],
      "agent": "opencode",
      "verifyCommand": ["/path/to/resolve-agent-executable"]
    },
    {
      "id": "pi",
      "label": "Pi",
      "argv": ["pi"],
      "agent": "pi"
    }
  ]
}
```

GitHub polls are staggered across `pollSeconds` (30 by default), including on
startup. With three unique repository/branch targets, a poll starts roughly
every 10 seconds. Workspaces sharing a target share its result. Polls run one
at a time; slow requests can extend the interval. Failed targets wait at least
`retrySeconds` before retrying. Workspace discovery still runs every
`pollSeconds`, with `concurrency` controlling discovery and indicator updates.
Staggering spreads request bursts; increase `pollSeconds` to reduce total API use.

`showSuccess` defaults to `false`. Set it to `true` to show `CI: ✓` when at least
one run succeeds and all runs have completed with success, neutral or skipped
conclusions. Pending, cancelled and empty run lists do not show a checkmark.

Loading appears when a GitHub status request starts, including refreshes, and is
replaced when the poll results are published. Cached targets waiting for their
next poll or retry keep their existing status. Once loaded, unavailable status
takes priority over failures, then in-progress runs, then success. In-progress
includes all runs that have not completed, including queued and waiting runs,
and does not require `showSuccess`.

`indicatorTemplates` controls each indicator's text, including icons, spacing
and punctuation. Omitted entries use the defaults shown above. Templates must
be non-empty strings; every `{count}` in `failure` is replaced with the number
of runs needing attention. The other templates are literal text.

For compact icons, use:

```json
{
  "showSuccess": true,
  "indicatorTemplates": {
    "failure": "✗ {count}",
    "unavailable": "⚠",
    "loading": "…",
    "inProgress": "↻",
    "success": "✓"
  }
}
```

Each template is published as one `$timmo_workflow_watch` token. Update the
sidebar colour rules' `equals` values to match your templates:

```toml
[ui.sidebar.spaces]
rows = [
  ["state_icon", "workspace"],
  [
    "branch",
    "git_status",
    { token = "$timmo_workflow_watch", fg = "#f38ba8", dim = false, rules = [
       { equals = "⚠", fg = "#f9e2af" },
       { equals = "…", fg = "#89b4fa" },
       { equals = "↻", fg = "#f9e2af" },
       { equals = "✓", fg = "#a6e3a1" },
    ] },
  ],
]
```

The whole indicator uses one colour: red for failures, blue for loading, amber
for unavailable or in-progress status and green for success. Templates can
contain text, symbols or both.
The success template still requires `showSuccess: true`.

Omit `launchers` to use the built-in choices: OpenCode, Pi, Cursor Agent, Claude
Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, OMP, Devin, Droid, Kimi, Kilo, Hermes, Qoder CLI,
Qwen, Mastra Code, Antigravity CLI and Grok. A configured array replaces the
defaults; `"launchers": []` disables new-agent actions.

Only launchers with an installed Herdr integration (`current` or `outdated`) and
an executable command appear. The agent does not need to be running already.
If none are available, both new-agent actions are disabled.

Each launcher has a unique `id`, a display `label`, an `argv` command and Herdr's
detected `agent` name. `argv[0]` can be an executable path or a command resolved
through Bash's login environment. Arguments are shell-quoted. `integration`
optionally overrides the integration name checked for availability; it defaults
to `agent` (Antigravity CLI uses integration `antigravity-cli` and agent `agy`).

For wrappers or multiple versions of the same agent, set `verifyCommand` to print
the single absolute executable path expected in the new pane's foreground argv.
The plugin checks that process before submitting work. All launches wait for
Herdr to detect the selected agent as ready. Changing or removing the selected
launcher requires reopening the picker.

Keep personal launcher settings in your own config, outside the plugin checkout.

Polls are bounded to 10-3600 seconds, retries to 30-3600 seconds, command timeouts
to 5-120 seconds and concurrency to 1-8. Retries are never faster than polling.
The watcher checks its installed bundle and configuration every two seconds.
After a change is stable across two checks, it stops polling, clears its
indicators and releases its lease before starting a replacement. Invalid config
edits are reported once per error; the existing watcher keeps running until the
file is corrected. Missing bundle files during an update defer the restart.

Watchers started before automatic reload was added need one manual restart:
disable the plugin, wait for the watcher lease to disappear, enable it and invoke
the start action. Later updates and configuration changes restart automatically.

Errors produce a short Herdr notification with a suggested next step. Invalid
configuration is reported before startup, including the setting that failed
validation. Full error details and stack traces stay in the Effect JSON logs;
fatal command errors exit with a non-zero status. If Herdr cannot receive the
notification, the delivery failure is logged too.

Workspace discovery and GitHub polling errors notify when first encountered or
when the error changes. A successful check resets this, so a later failure can
notify again. Repeated identical polling failures stay in the logs.

The plugin uses `HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR` for configuration and a socket-specific
directory under `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` for its lease, `watch.log`, `dispatch.log`,
`status.json` and saved failure output. There is one watcher per server socket;
workspaces sharing a repository and remote branch share GitHub requests. Startup
and workspace hooks start it idempotently. It exits after the plugin is disabled
or the session becomes unavailable, and indicators have a TTL.

Discovery prefers an attached worktree, then a pane directory in the workspace.
It watches the configured GitHub upstream, falling back to GitHub origin.
Detached checkouts, missing remote branches, non-Git directories and non-GitHub
remotes are skipped. Incomplete or failed GitHub requests show unavailable state.

Use `herdr plugin list --plugin timmo.workflow-watch --json` and
`herdr plugin log list --plugin timmo.workflow-watch` for registration and hook
diagnostics. The socket-specific logs contain watcher and action details.

## Development

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) pins Bun and Node and runs the project tasks.

Herdr requests use the Effect-native [`@herdr/sdk`](https://github.com/dmmulroy/herdr-ts-sdk).
Until it is published, the dependency is pinned to a GitHub commit. The Bun patch
in `patches/` exposes its TypeScript entrypoint for Bun to bundle. Dependency
overrides reference our direct Effect and platform dependencies, so updating
those versions also updates the SDK's dependencies without separate override
edits. The SDK's own manifest still pins an older beta. Keep the commit, patch
and lockfile together when updating it, and recheck protocol compatibility.

```sh
mise install
mise run install
mise run check
mise run build
bun dist/index.js --help
```

Use `mise run format` to format source and configuration.
CI installs dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Build, lint and
the CLI smoke check run independently. Build output is a Bun module in `dist/`.
Validation is lint, strict types, formatting, build, CLI help and local plugin
registration/startup. Interactive behaviour is tested manually.
